🌤️ SwiftUI Weather App
A modern iOS weather application built with SwiftUI and MVVM architecture.
The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeather API, processes JSON responses, and displays current conditions along with a 7-day forecast.

🚀 Features

🌍 City-based search – Enter any city to get real-time weather updates

📡 Networking layer – API integration with error handling and JSON parsing.

🌓 Dynamic UI – Changes icons and layout based on day/night and weather conditions.

📅 7-Day Forecast – Displays daily predictions grouped by date.

🎨 Clean SwiftUI Interface – Gradient backgrounds, SF Symbols for weather icons, and responsive design.

🏗 MVVM – Organized code with ViewModel, Model, and View.
